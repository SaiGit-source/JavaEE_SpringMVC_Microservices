Multithreading part 3:

Intra -> within same class, we are able to enable communications between threads

Inter thread communications : 
Producer thread -> Consumer threads they are in two different classes

class Producer extends Thread
{
// Logic to produce new data

}

class Consumer extends Thread
{
// 

}

class Queue (mediator class)
{


}

new Producer(q).start(); // here only once the object is being called so Anonymous object
new Consumer(q).start(); 

Producer should produce only when the Consumer has consumed. if Consumer has not consumed the data, then Producer must not produce
So we use synchronized keyword

A thread gets out of sleep state when it encounters the notify() method

for interthread communication, we need wait() and notify() methods. Notify wakes only threads in wait state
