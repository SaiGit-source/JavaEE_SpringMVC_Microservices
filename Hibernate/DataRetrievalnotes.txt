Data retrieval:

Student student = session.get(Student.class, 1);
at ID 1, i want to get record from the table

we want to communicate with Hibernate. we have given class details, to which Hibernate has to map to the table. we have given configuration to Hibernate like entity class. Based on this, Hibernate will write the SQL query

select * from table where ID=? // Hibernate will create one JDBC environment. all of them are taken care by Hibernate

the return data type will be ResultSet -> it is a representation of one record -> behind the scene, Hibernate will create an object of Student. through setters Hibernate will inject the value. Hibernate will inject data into object. As a Java developer we are only working with objects


Can we retrieve data from database using get() method? the answer is Yes the other is load() method
