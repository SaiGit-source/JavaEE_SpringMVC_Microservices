Hibernate:

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework -> Hibernate

Pre-requisites
Java, DBMS, MySQL, JDBC,  

With Hibernate, how can we store data, update data or manipulate data

Persistence -> Storing or managing data for long-term (in Java, we store data in Array or Variables but they are temporary -> the moment Java program execution is finished, the data is gone)
We want to store the data in a place so we could use the data again -> that's Persistency (process of storing or managing data for longer term)

two options -> 1. File operations (HDD, DVD etc), 2. Database (Storing in the form of table)

Persistence store -> storage area where we keep data for longer term
1. File operations (Storing in HDD) java.io.* package, 2. Database (Storing in the form of Table) java.sql.* package (store data from Java application into Database)

Persistence data -> data in persistence store is called as Persistence data (DB tables)

Persistence operation -> CRUD operation or operations performed on the persistence data

Persistence logic -> logic or code to perform persistence operations Eg IO streams logic, JDBC API, Hibernate code, Spring JDBC, Spring ORM, Spring DataJPA 

Persistence Technology/Framework -> The technology or framework through which we write persistence logic Eg. Technology - JDBC, Frameworks - Hibernate, SpringJDBC, SpringORM, SpringDataJPA
