Hibernate Architecture

Java application -> .java file -> lets say we write a class representing table in the database

class Student 
{
private Integer id;
private String name;
private String city;


setters() and getters()
}

this class is called as Entity -> to map this class into table in the database -> we have a specification called as JPA (Java Persistence API or Jakarta Persistence API) both are same

  
JPA given by J2EE technology

now we will have to talk to Hibernate -> two ways: XML or Annotation approach -> we are going to communicate to Hibernate -> to map table in the database

XML / Annotation:
Student STUDENT
id -> ID
name -> NAME
city -> CITY

configuration information: database Url, Username, Password -> we got to give to Hibernate

we have to create a class, which is a representation of the database. the queries are also taken care by Hibernate

JDBC is also used behind the scenes. 

the moment you activate Hibernate we got to give the details -> mapping and configuration details
