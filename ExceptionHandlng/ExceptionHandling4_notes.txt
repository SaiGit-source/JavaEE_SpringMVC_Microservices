Exception Handling part 4

What's the need of exception? we could manage with if-else?
if i make some errors, if-else will provide only one chance. 

one more use case of EH is, we can precisely control how many exceptions we could throw. say you can throw 3 times.
with try-catch we can precisely control the program flow

say if i enter wrong username and Password, it will not come under any of the standard category. so we create a Custom exception

Custom Exception: create a class
class InvalidCustomerException extends RuntimeException // this is checked exception so we could do Exception
{
	
}

InvalidCustomerException ice = new InvalidCustomerException();
throw ice;
or
throw new InvalidCustomerException();
