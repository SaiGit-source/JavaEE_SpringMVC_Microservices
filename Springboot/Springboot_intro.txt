Springboot:

How can you make Application asap?

we focus more on convention than configuration

IntelliJ -> SpringBoot -> Java -> select Maven -> dependencies

this feature of creating SpringBoot is available only in Ultimate version

Community version:

takes to Spring initializr -> select Java, Maven, SpringBoot 3.3.5 (dependency Spring framework version 6, Spring 6 needs Java 17 min) etc -> Jar -> 21 -> add dependency

in pom file, we need only two dependency -> spring starter, spring test

just run the project -> we should see "Spring" printed

Dependency injection without any configuration thats the good thing about Springboot


SpringBoot = Spring + Auto-configuration

SpringBoot automatically gives us application context or IOCContainer


latest SpringBoot version is 3 -> internally they use Spring framework 6 -> minimum requirement is Java 17

Only way is Spring Initializr (Spring tool suite, IntelliJ) -> start.io. in Eclipse, we can integrate STS

Gradle is a competitor of Maven ->
