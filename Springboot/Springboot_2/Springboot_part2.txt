Springboot part 2:
 
Precedence: 	Static block -> when class gets loaded in JVM
		Java init block -> 
		Constructor
		Method call


Bean Lifecycle: Bean lifecycle and Java lifecycle are the same


To create a bean of the class: i will have to apply @Component annotation

@PostConstruct -> after Constructor this method is getting called
@PreDestroy -> before bean destruction it is executed

without @Autowired we can perform only Constructor injection

for Setter and Field injection, we need @Autowired


Connection pooling: behind the scene Spring framework uses Hikary CP
 

We only asked Spring to create 3 beans, behind the scene -> Spring is creating 52 extra beans total 55 beans
