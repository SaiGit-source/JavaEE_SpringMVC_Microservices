MultiDB config:

SpringBoot App should get connected to multiple DBs like PostgresSQL, MySQL
dependencies : Spring Web, JPA, Postgres driver, MySQL driver, dev tools
we cannot configure two DBs in the same application.properties we need to write our own Config files
SpringCloudConfiguration to separate yaml file from application for security purposes
