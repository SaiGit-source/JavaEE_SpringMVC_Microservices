Wora - Write Once Read Anywhere

Java is platform-independent unlike C.

Java sourcecode -> Java compiler (Javac) -> Bytecode -> JVM -> Machine code MLL


This Bytecode is non-readable and it can be read only by JVM. So it can be transported to any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). But JVM is platform-dependent so it converts Bytecode into MLL for the respective platform. Bytecode usually has extension .class.

JVM is written in C language that's why it is platform-dependent
