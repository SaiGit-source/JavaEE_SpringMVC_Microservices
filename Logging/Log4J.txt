Logging with Log4J:

i want to get updates / details from application. how do we get info about application? 

if you want to know something about application, we log onto console. Console is only limited so we can keep only Limited information there and that too it is temporary

App -> Compile/Build/Deployed -> App.war (Server) -> (request and response) Client. Client making a request to Server and getting response.

Logging can be anything about -> message, error and application status when application is in production or when it is running as App.war on server. you can log onto console using Log4J

Logging:
1. getting info about application when it is in production to monitor application
2. using log files we can find bugs

Logging tools: Log4J, Java logging, Commons logging

Where to store logging messages? Console (System.out.println) and Files(.log), Database(table), Email messages 

3 components: Logger (Which classes you want to participate in logger process -> where to create Logger objects so classes can participate in logging process), Appender (Where to store -> console, file, mail), Layout (Format -> how to print or store log messages)
