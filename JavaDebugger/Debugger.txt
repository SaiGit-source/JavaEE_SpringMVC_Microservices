Debugger:

Eclipse IDE

create a class -> debug as -> Java application -> 

there is something called as Breakpoint: CTRL + SHIFT + B or double click the line number

DebugAs -> Java application

StepOver -> F6

Window -> Show View -> Breakpoints to see Breakpoints.
Window -> Perspective -> Breakpoints to see Breakpoints.

inside the loop do StepOver and check i value


on the left pane, i can see Main thread -> F8 to resume -> if there are any other breakpoints it will go to that breakpoint


StepOver -> line-by-line we are checking
Resume -> it will stop only at the breakpoints (it will debug only breakpoints)

StepInto  -> go into the body of the method()

For threads -> once we start(), only after that we can see threads on the left pane


Threads, run, Runnable

synchronized: 
Bank -> 3 activities so 3 threads -> withdrawal, deposit, bank check

3 activities are happening at the same time -> co-ordinations between threads -> synchronized keyword

when there is only one abstract method() -> it is a functional interface -> lambda is suitable
