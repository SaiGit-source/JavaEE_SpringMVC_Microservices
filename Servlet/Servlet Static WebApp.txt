Static WebApp using Servlet:

Eclipse -> File -> New -> Dynamic web project -> name: FirstWebApplication -> Apache Tomcat_v10 -> content directory: src/main/webapp is ok -> next -> Finish

open project -> look for webapp -> rightclick HTML file -> index.html (automatically server will identify index.html)

rightclick html file, run on server because we dont want to execute on JVM instead Server

runs on "http://localhost:8085/FirstWebApp/index.html"


For Dynamic application: we need to develop a Servlet that has capability to handle both requests and responses. so we write that into Java folder not webapp folder
Right-click src/java -> new Servlet

Right-click -> project itself -> Run as Run on Server
