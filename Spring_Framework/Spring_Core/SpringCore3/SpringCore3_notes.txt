SpringCore 3:

Base annotation of stereotype annotation is @Component, it will create a Bean of the class


Application with no XML and only 100% Annotation


public class Employee(Integer empid, String name, Double salary)
{

}

XML with parameterized constructor:
if we have a param constructor, zero param constructor will not exist by default

in param constructor, Spring needs params to create Bean of class. we need these parameters to create bean

<bean id="emp1" class="service.Employee">
// we need constructor-arg tag not property tag here
<constructor-arg value="01" />
<constructor-arg value="Abc" /> // name
.
.
.
</bean>


<bean id="emp1" class="service.Employee">
<constructor-arg name="empid" value="01" /> or <constructor-arg index="0" value="01" />
<constructor-ard name="salary" value="2334.23" />
....
</bean>

***************************

<bean id="depart" class="service.Department" c:dpNo="1" c:dpName="Alien"/> c means constructor, p means property (setter injection)

Spring framework approaches
1.Pure XML approach
2.XML + Annotation is recommended 
3.Java configuration + Annotation approach -> problem is small change in Java code, we have to re-compile entire application
4.Last approach is Springboot -> this is the easiest and recommended. if Springboot is not there, then XML+Annotation is recommended
