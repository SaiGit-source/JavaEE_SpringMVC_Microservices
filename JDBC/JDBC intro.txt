Java Database Connectivity

there are recent frameworks like Spring JDBC, Hibernate etc, still we got to learn JDBC to understand behind the scene. it will help to troubleshoot and optimize the code

Need for JDBC

entire Software relies on data heavily. everywhere we are trying to share information. so there is a requirement to take and store data in permanent place

in Java, we have an option to store in Array, Collection, Variable etc. 

if we want to store data in a Database then we need JDBC

How do we store data on a Database regardless of where it is like cloud, remote server, local ? Java application should get connected to Database to store the data

in Relational database, where we can store data in the form of tables

JDBC program enables to connect Java program to connect to Database, anything data-related operation: storing, manipulating, retrieving

Java App/Program <=> JDBC <=> Database (local server/remote/cloud)


Steps in developing a JDBC application:

1. Import the required package (Also download & Add Database specific jar file into the project). for example to connect with Oracle database, we need to download Oracle jar file, similar MySQL jar, 

2. Add jar into project before proceeding with coding

Java team has developed a lot of interfaces with methods(), implementation is done by different DB vendors like MySQL, OracleDB, PostgresDB and they are in the form of jar files
search keyword: mysql jdbc driver download
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/  select Platform Independent

Create a new Java project -> right click Build path -> Configure build path -> Libraries tab -> Classpath -> Add Library -> User library -> new -> Enter MySQL library name -> Apply&Close -> Finish -> Add External Jar

Open MySQL workbench
run this query
use jdbclearning;

CREATE 	table studentInfo1 (
id INT not null,
sname VARCHAR(40) not null,
sage INT not null,
scity VARCHAR(40) not null,
PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

then run MySQLConnect.java

create a new package -> class -> import java.sql.*; delete module-info.java if necessary

Java App -> interface<> name and method() name is the same (also called as implementation class or JDBC driver) -> Database

3. Load and register driver

4. Establish connection from Java to Database

5. Create the statement

6. Execute the query

7. Process the result

8. Close the connection


These are the boiler plate code we got to write again and again for all CRUD operations in JDBC. we create the table, update, or delete the same boiler plate code will be there
instead we use frameworks to avoid repetition of the boiler plate code


Prepared Statement: Statement interface vs PreparedStatement interface<>
in PreparedStatement, i can assign values dynamically into SQL statements. INSERT INTO studentInfo1(id, sname, sage, scity) VALUES(?,?,?,?)

then we set values using prepStatement.setInt(1, id); // first placeholder in the query has integer datatype

i think it's more like Jinja in Python, dynamically assign values into SQL query during runtime

Statement is the parent interface<> -> PreparedStatement is the child interface<> -> 
Statement stmt = connect.createStatement();	|	PreparedStatement psmt = connect.prepareStatement(query);
stmt.executeQuery(query);			|	psmt.executeUpdate();
stmt.executeUpdate(query);			|
stmt.executeUpdate(sqlQuery);			|
// using one stmt object from createStatement(),| 
i can invoke this object multiple times	
						|	using single psmt object, we cannot execute multiple times. we are passing the SQl 													query into only once at prepareStatement()
Here, Query will be compiled by DBEngine and	|	here, compile once only and 100 times executed. only once query will be compiled during the prepareStatement object creation
that will be executed				| 	only pre-compiled query gets executed
if you compile the same query 100 times, 	|	
100 times compiled and executed.		|
here we create multiple query object		|

Batch update
		String sql = "UPDATE studentinfo1 SET sage=? WHERE id=?";	i want to update 5 records in the table then i got to repeat the same query again and again. now each time, database hits are more here. for each query, each time i am going to the database from Java

how to achieve better performance? One query for multiple operations

Batch update works only for non-select queries: insert, delete and update
