Encapsulation:
{private, setter, getter, constructor, this, }

class Book {
private int pageNum;  // because this is private this variable cannot be accessed by book.pageNum from main method 

void setBook(int pg){
if (pg>=0){
pageNum = pg; // now this variable is protected with private clause
}
}

Shadowing problem
