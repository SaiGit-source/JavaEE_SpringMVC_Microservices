Batch processing:

Processing thousands of pay slips of employees. at a time, they are processing thousands of records. Processing bulk data at a time.

use chatGPT to generate a large CSV file. -> read all records -> Use SpringBoot to process the dataset and store permanently in database


Fastest programming language -> C -> Rust -> Java ...... -> Python. Slowest language is Python

Spring Batch Terminologies:

JobLauncher
Job
Step -> ItemReader, for this you got to specify Source from where i got to read data and write data. ItemReader will read data into application. Read data into application so configure Item Reader
     -> ItemWriter, write data into destination (Database).
     -> ItemProcessor. all these are configured into something called as JobRepository


All ItemReader, ItemWriter, ItemProcessor will be configured into Step. Step is inside Job. Within one job, there can be multiple Steps. but within each Job, we have only one ItemReader, one ItemWriter, and one ItemProcessor

JobLauncher launches the job. 

JobLauncher -> Job -> Step -> one ItemReader, one ItemWriter, one ItemProcessor
     |		|	|
	  JobRepository

Job is insider JobLauncher then we give all information to JobRepository

Security configuration or Batch job configuration is one-time setup. Add "Spring Batch" dependency in Spring application. Others include Spring Web, MySQL Driver, SpringDataJPA, Spring Boot Dev tools

in application.properties set spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema=ALWAYS
