Spring Data JPA

Java + SpringCore + Hibernate -> prerequisites for SpringDataJPA

say if you have 100 tables then 100 classes -> same thing we are doing CRUD

to simplify entire web repository layer -> Spring says Repo logic we will give you

Java Persistence API (JPA) -> now known as Jakarta Persistence API

JPA -> Hibernate -> Spring Data JPA

Specify what you want, someone-else will give you implementation -> Interface -> interface provides specification

CRUD repository, Pagging and Sorting Repository and JPA Repository -> all these are Interface

Mongo Repository() interface for NoSQL database

for Spring Data JPA, we need Spring Data JPA, MySQL driver dependency

jdbc:mysql:///finishers also work

to see what kind of SQL queries are generated : spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

extends CrudRepository<>

At runtime, one Proxy class will take care of the implementation, we dont have to write implementation
