Spring Profile

Profile:
Software Development -> two steps: Step1: Writing the code (Developer task), Step2: Building & Deployment(Devops task) -> write code push to Git -> pull code from Git then build and deploy on Kubernetes. Jenkins will automate the build and deploy application. Three environments: first deploy on Dev environment, then SIT (System in Testing), then UAT, Pilot env and Prod environment. Prod env means application is deployed for the entire world. end users can access the application

Dev env might have a different database MySQL 8080, SIT might be on PostGres 8081, UAT on Oracle 8084 and so on. to avoid making changes in application multiple times, thats why we have SpringBoot Profiles. Create multiple profiles or create multiple application.properties/configuration files. Application becomes flexible for different environment configurations.

@Profile() takes precedence over @Primary. It includes only those beans in the application that are mentioned in the application.properties file
