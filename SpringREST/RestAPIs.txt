RestAPIs:
Before Rest we had SOAP-based web services. it was invented by Roy Fielding


4 projects:

1. Banking rewards: group project - Whenever we purchase with credit card, it gives Rewards. Person should be able to redeem the points, show products on the page, there should be points for the purchase, whenever user register, we can give 1000 points, whenever user does a transaction, we give points like 10 points for 100Rs transaction. do random simulation of transactions every 5 seconds with random amount.

2. Ecommerce: individual project
4 weeks:
1 week-MVP -> we need to write code
2 week-product -> need to code

3. Tours and Travel:
They will give requirements later

4. Realtime quiz - group project
similar to Menti. we got to learn WebSocket


Two services are talking to each other like Udemy and Paypal. when one application is talking to another application it is called as Distributed Enterprise App

Technologies for RestAPIs or to develop Distributed Enterprise Application: CORBA, RMI (one application can seek help of another application), Java came up with Enterprise Java Bean (EJB). the problem with EJB was it was difficult to maintain. with EJB, we cannot connect to another application with a non-Java tech stack. Say Paypal must be in Java as well for EJB to work.

WSI: Web Services Interoperability -> we should come up with business services over web by achieving interoperability. they came up with BP.1.0 -> Basic Profile. in this case, a Java application can talk to a Python Django application. to exchange data between application, thats where web services/Restful services come in picture. Java came up with JAX_RPC to exchange data. web services interoperability help to exchange information between different applications.

After BP.1.0 success BP.1.1. was released. Java team came up with JAX_WS based on specifications from WSI. Apache Axis, IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic, they all provided their own implementations. JAX is Java API for XML. These web services is called as SOAP based web services. for a Java developer it is based on JAX_RPC or JAX_WS. XML is the data exchange format between different applications. Application 1 in Python -> XML object -> Application 2 in Java. For Java developers, in SOAP based services, we use two terminologies Marshelling (Java to XML object) and Unmarshelling (XML to Java object). one application seeking help (consumer application) of another application (provider or producer application).  We document APIs using WSDL -> XML document with producer API information. Consumer -> WSDL -> UDDI -> Producer API. Web Services Description Language -> WSDL (documentation of APIs). UDDI -> Universal Description Discovery Integration. This is the architecture of SOAP based web services

JSON:
due to SOAP-based web services disadvantages, Roy Fielding came up with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). lets replace XML with JSON. Fielding introduced RESTful services. The address should be unique. Uniform Constant Interface. Based on REST specification, Java came up with JAX_RS. Client -> HTTPRequest -> Rest resource. REST resource sends back HTTPResponse. data exchange format can be in both XML and JSON. SpringMVC has something internally called as SpringREST. SpringMVC uses JacksonAPI to convert JSON object to Java object and vice-versa. Dispatcher servlet(JacksonAPI) will convert say Java Student object into JSON object and vice-versa. void disp(Student st) and returns st Student object only. JacksonAPI will take care of the remaining things. if you add @ResponseBody to a controller method, it becomes a RestAPI. Browser doesn't send JSON data thats why we need Postman tool to test APIs

@Controller + @ResponseBody = @RestController
@RequestBody converts JSON format into Java object -> we use to receive JSON data
for editing data: PUT or PATCH method

What's Global Exception Handling?
For Update, we have @PutMapping, @PatchMapping -> to update majority portion of record, PutMapping otherwise go with PatchMapping

Primary logic -> Application logic, Exception handling is secondary logic (AOP)

Purpose of Controller method is receive HttpRequest process then give it back -> @RestControllerAdvice (exception is handled automatically). @ExceptionHandler -> no try and catch.

Main purpose of AOP is to separate main logic and secondary logic -> Aspect Oriented Programming

Globally i would like to handle exceptions of the application. When i send request to RestAPI, it calls the service method to process the request. if exception occurs, instead of exception going to RestController it goes into RestControllerAdvice. that's Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)

How to integrate third party application like Paypal into our application? RestTemplate (Synchronous) or WebClient (Asynchronous communication)

Scopes, Swagger: Passenger details -> Web app -> Book a ticket (Two Applications interacting with APIs)
				   <- 	      <-(response)


*******************************************************
Interacting with other APIs:

we are developing APIs for use by some other developers so we dont share code source, thats why we use @Operation(). how to connect from one appln to another appln via APIs? thats why we need RestTemplate and WebClient

Reactive programming: For WebClient add Spring Reactive Web dependency in Spring application. Method chaining webClient.post().uri(url).body(passenger).retrieve().bodyToMono(Integer.class).block(); // block for synchronous request. post request to URL send body, retrieve convert response to Integer class.

WebClient
block() means webclient will act as Synchronous that means thread will wait. But if you use Subscribe it is Asynchronous communication that means thread will not wait

RestTemplate is only for Synchronous communication

When to go with RestTemplate vs WebClient

if you want to make a call to third-party APIs like PayPal, Razor, WhatsApp, we got to use either RestTemplate or WebClient
	
WeatherApp -> City -> ZipCode API   	WeatherApp -> ZipCode -> WeatherAPI 
	<- ZipCode				    <-- Weather info

if ZipCode API doesn't generate ZipCode we cannot run WeatherAPI so one thread must wait if we dont have response from ZipCodeAPI. without response from ZipCode API we cannot call Weather Info API -> Synchronous communication (by default RestTemplate supports that, WebClient with block. that means dont proceed further unless we have a response from API1, when you use WebClient with subscribe() method then it becomes asynchronous communication)  

Sometimes we want Emp Personal Info and Emp payslip both APIs are independent of each other so communication can happen in parallel. So Asynchronous communication will work here. WebClient with subscribe() method will do

*************************************************

XML:
To convert XML to Java object and vice-versa, we use @JacksonXmlRootElement on top of model class. for that we take maven dependency for Jackson dataformat XML. XML interaction is needed to access SOAP-based APIs

*************************************

Spring Profiles:
Software Development -> two steps: Step1: Writing the code (Developer task), Step2: Building & Deployment(Devops task) -> write code push to Git -> pull code from Git then build and deploy on Kubernetes. Jenkins will automate the build and deploy application. Three environments: first deploy on Dev environment, then SIT (System in Testing), then UAT, Pilot env and Prod environment. Prod env means application is deployed for the entire world. end users can access the application

Dev env might have a different database MySQL 8080, SIT might be on PostGres 8081, UAT on Oracle 8084 and so on. to avoid making changes in application multiple times, thats why we have SpringBoot Profiles. Create multiple profiles or create multiple application.properties/configuration files. Application becomes flexible for different environment configurations.

@Profile() takes precedence over @Primary

*******************************************

Spring Hateos:
Dont give all information fully and give only if enduser clicks on it requesting information
in eCommerce websites, first we see some products, then it says more info, they have to click only then you will see more products
first give limited information, then provide links for more information

********************************

Spring Scopes: Singleton, Prototypes, Request, Session
Default scope of all projects is Singleton then we have Prototype

whenever we create a bean, constructor will be invoked. Default scope of all beans is Singleton


ITouristService repo; // only one implementing class is there, so no confusion for IOCContainer during dependency injection

even though the object is getting injected multiple times, still the bean is being created only once. if it is Singleton, it supports eager initialization, one bean per IOCContanier. doesn't matter how many times we are using the beans

to change scope, we say @Scope("prototype") or @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)

Default scope of all beans is Singleton

In Singleton, the bean is getting created no matter whether it is being used or not, thats eager initialization. (Eager initialization and One bean for all dep injections)

In Prototype, how many times you are injecting the beans, that many number of beans are getting created. everytime you want to inject the bean that many times it is getting created. if you perform 10 dependency injection of a particular object, 10 times bean is being created, that's Prototype scope. Prototype promotes LAZY initialization. say if you are not using the bean, Protype scope will not create a bean (Lazy initialization and num of beans depends on num of injections)

In Request scope, usually we apply to APIs or Controller methods. @Scope("request") in Controller. Unless and until you dont use the bean, there wont be bean created. LAZY initialization. In Controller, only when the API is being called, the bean is created. Bean will be created everytime there is a HTTP request to Application. if we have 100 requests, then 100 bean is created

In Session scope, when you make a request to an application one Session ID is created. after that, for next n requests, the same Session ID is being used. that means the same user is making the requests. @Scope("session"). this is also applied to Controller. it supports LAZY initialization. As soon as i make the request, TouristRestAPI bean is created. TouristRestAPI is the Controller class. Only one controller bean will be created for entire user session. 

Mostly we go with the default scope, which is Singleton. Default container SpringBoot follows is Application Context and it support EAGER Initialization. however, we can make beans behave like Lazy using @Scope().
